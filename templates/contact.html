<h1>About Acer Corner</h1>

<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>Acer Corner began as a passion project in the late 1990s when owners Michael and Sarah Thompson moved to their Wendover property. What started with just three Japanese maples purchased at a local garden center has grown into one of the most extensive private collections of Acers in Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>The garden has been developed with careful attention to aspect, soil conditions, and companion planting to create ideal growing conditions for these sometimes temperamental trees. The Chiltern Hills location provides the perfect backdrop, with its natural woodland setting and sheltered position.</p>

<h2>Garden Development</h2>

<p>Over the years, we've transformed what was once a conventional English garden into a series of interconnected spaces that showcase our Acer collection while creating tranquil spots for contemplation and enjoyment of nature.</p>

<p>Key developments include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2003:</strong> Creation of the main water feature and stream system</li>
    <li><strong>2006:</strong> Development of the Japanese-inspired garden section</li>
    <li><strong>2010:</strong> Introduction of the woodland walk area</li>
    <li><strong>2015:</strong> Installation of the tea garden and viewing platform</li>
    <li><strong>2020:</strong> Addition of the new rare species collection</li>
    <li><strong>2023:</strong> Expansion of the autumn color garden section</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conservation & Sustainability</h2>

<p>At Acer Corner, we're committed to sustainable gardening practices. Our rainwater harvesting system supplies most of our garden's watering needs, and we maintain a strict no-chemical policy, relying instead on natural pest control methods and organic approaches.</p>

<p>We're also proud to participate in conservation efforts for rare Acer varieties through our membership in the South Bucks Japanese Circle (SBJC) and collaboration with botanical gardens.</p>

<h2>National Garden Scheme</h2>

<p>We've been opening our garden through the National Garden Scheme since 2012, helping to raise funds for nursing and health charities. We're proud to be part of this wonderful tradition that allows garden lovers to visit exceptional private gardens while supporting worthy causes.</p>

<p>Over the years, visitors to Acer Corner have contributed over Â£15,000 to National Garden Scheme charities through entrance fees and plant sales.</p>

<h2>Awards & Recognition</h2>

<p>Acer Corner has been featured in several regional gardening publications, including:</p>
