        <p>
            My name is Jo Naiman, and Acer Corner is the name I use for the company. I originally studied electrical engineering and worked for 20 years in IT, mostly for Telecommunications companies, developing software and later designing and project managing large billing projects. While software design and project management present some creative challenges, after 20 years I was looking for a different outlet for my creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time my hobbies helped hone my appreciation for good design and attention to details. My keen interest in photography has introduced me to depth and layout. I studied towards a degree in far eastern studies which opened a new world of design concepts and new hobbies - Japanese embroidery and Japanese Gardens.
        </p>
        <p>
            I left IT in 2009, and in summer 2011 graduated with distinction from Birkbeck University of London with a foundation degree in garden design taken at Capel Manor College.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2009 I have been designing, renovating and maintaining gardens. My own garden has been open for the National Garden Scheme since 2008, and is used as a showcase for what can be achieved in a typical size garden.
        </p>
        <p>I am a member of the Japanese Garden Society. The gardens I design are not Japanese, but I do follow some Japanese principles in both design and maintenance.</p>
